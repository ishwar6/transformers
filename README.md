# Comprehensive Guide to Transformers

This repository is designed to be a comprehensive resource for understanding the Transformer architecture, a groundbreaking innovation in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and beyond. It covers everything from the fundamental concepts of the original Transformer model to the latest advancements and variations like BERT, GPT, Claude, Falcon 40B, Gemini and T5. The goal is to provide an in-depth exploration of the theory, practical implementations, and the evolution of the Transformer models.
