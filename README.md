## Introduction
Transformers have revolutionized the way machines understand and generate human language. Introduced by Vaswani et al. in the seminal paper "Attention is All You Need", transformers have quickly become the backbone of modern NLP systems.

## Basics of Deep Learning
Before diving into transformers, it is essential to understand the foundational concepts of deep learning:
- **Neural Networks**
- **Backpropagation and Optimization**
- **Sequence Modeling**: RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs
