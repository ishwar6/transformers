# Fine-Tuning Language Models for Dialogue Summary Generation

## Project Overview

This project aims to enhance the performance of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) by fine-tuning them on a domain-specific dataset. The goal is to generate concise summaries from extended dialogues, leveraging the capabilities of transformer-based models and efficient fine-tuning methods.

## Why Fine-Tuning?

Fine-tuning allows us to adapt a generic pre-trained model to specific tasks by training it further on a smaller, task-specific dataset. This process retains the broad linguistic capabilities acquired during the original training while adapting the model to perform well on targeted tasks with reduced data and computational needs.

## Fine-Tuning Methodology

We use Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, specifically:

1. **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)** - Modifies a subset of the model's weights, enabling it to adapt to new tasks while maintaining most of the original parameters unchanged.
2. **Quantized LoRA (QLoRA)** - Introduces quantization into the LoRA approach to further reduce the memory and computational overhead.

These methods are selected to balance the fine-tuning efficiency with performance, minimizing the risk of catastrophic forgetting and making the process computationally feasible.

## Dataset

We use the `neil-code/dialogsum-test` dataset from the Hugging Face Hub, which contains structured dialogues and their corresponding summaries.
