# why? : to enhance their performance (LLMs) on specific tasks by adapting them to domain-specific data. 

# Fine-tuning LLM involves the additional training of a pre-existing model, which has previously acquired patterns and features from an extensive dataset, using a smaller, domain-specific dataset.
# Utilizing the existing knowledge embedded in the pre-trained model allows for achieving high performance on specific tasks with substantially reduced data and computational requirements.
