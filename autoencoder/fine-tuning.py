# Summary: Fine-tuning a BERT Model for Single-Sentence Binary Classification

# In this section, we demonstrate how to fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model for sentiment analysis using the IMDb dataset. The pre-trained model used is DistilBertForSequenceClassification, a distilled version of BERT with a classification head at the top.

# Key Steps

# 1. Setup and Initialization:
# Determine whether to use a GPU or CPU for training.
# Load the DistilBertForSequenceClassification model and tokenizer.

# 2. Dataset Preparation:
# Load the IMDb dataset for training, validation, and testing.
# Tokenize the datasets using the DistilBertTokenizerFast class.

# 3. Training Setup:
# Use the Trainer and TrainingArguments classes from the transformers library for training.
# Specify hyperparameters like the batch size, number of epochs, warmup steps, and weight decay.
# Define a compute_metrics function to calculate evaluation metrics like accuracy and F1 score.

# 4. Training and Evaluation:
# Create a Trainer object with the model, training arguments, datasets, and metrics function.
# Train the model and monitor metrics using logs.

# 5. Inference:
# Test the model's predictions using a get_prediction function.
# Save the fine-tuned model and use the Pipeline API to simplify predictions.

# 6. Results:
# The fine-tuned model achieved high accuracy and F1 scores on the IMDb dataset.
# The model is capable of classifying positive and negative sentiment reliably.
