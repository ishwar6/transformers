# Autoencoding Language Models with Transformers

This repository contains code and resources for understanding and training autoencoding language models using the Hugging Face `transformers` library. The models include BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, and ELECTRA, among others.

## Overview

- **Autoencoding Models**: These models leverage Transformer encoder architecture to provide contextual representations of input text.
  - **BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers): Trained using Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Next Sentence Prediction (NSP).
  - **ALBERT** (A Lite BERT): Optimizes the architecture by reducing memory usage and training time.
  - **RoBERTa** (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach): Improves upon BERT by using dynamic masking and a larger corpus.
  - **ELECTRA** (Efficiently Learning an Encoder that Classifies Token Replacements Accurately): Uses a generator-discriminator approach for better token detection.

- **Tokenization Algorithms**:
  - **WordPiece**: BERT's tokenizer that handles subword tokenization.
  - **Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)**: Used in RoBERTa and other models.
  - **SentencePiece**: For language-agnostic tokenization.
